## Analysis of the cost of 1kg of White Rice

### Source Data

First, I need to get the data for the price of a kg of white rice. I use [Numeo](https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/prices_by_country.jsp?displayCurrency=CAD&itemId=115). I scrape the table on the website.

#### Clean the data

The source data table comes with a `rank` row, which is filled with `nan`. I remove it. I test for duplicate values by `.group()`ing on "Country", and test for non float values in the price column. I scatterplot the data to see if i makes sense and if there are any outliers. ![](initial_scatterplot.png)
